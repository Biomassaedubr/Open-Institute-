# Module 1: Open Source for Big Ideas

## Welcome

## How to Participate

Each module has a few parts that you can move through at your own pace:
* Launch: an opening question or prompt to get your ideas flowing.
* Research: a short collection of background research, curated and provided for you.
* Design Challenge: an activity where you'll produce a piece of a playful project using open source software.
* Document: a brief write-up or summary of your Design Challenge for this module.

Each week we'll also have an hour-long "AMA" with a guest from open source, financial inclusion, or tech for good. You can participate in our Slack Channel in #general.
