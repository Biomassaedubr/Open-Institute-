# Module 1: Open Source to Solve Big Problems

## Launch

* Why did you sign up for this course? What do you want to accomplish here?
* What social issues are you concerned about in your community? Share a bit about your experience.
* What does "open source" mean to you? What is your experience with it?

## Research: How does open source solve big problems?


### Topical Resources:
#### Why does open source matter?
"Open Source Software is wonderful because it allows programmers and coders to coalesce around a platform like GitHub to build killer software, applications and programs for mass market use."
http://www.informit.com/blogs/blog.aspx?uk=Why-Open-Source-Matters-Musings-from-OSCON

"Why is openness important in hardware? "Because open hardware platforms become the platform where people start to develop their own products," Banzi told Ars."
-Massimo Banzi, ["Arduino creator explains why open source matters in hardware, too"](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/10/arduino-creator-explains-why-open-source-matters-in-hardware-too/)

* Introduction to Git that isn’t that technical (ideas from Bartek)
* [Markdown Basics](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/)

## Design Challenge

Challenge 1: Take a photo of a "friction moment"--how a social problem (literacy, lack of transportation, health care issues) comes up in your community. Could be broken parking meters, could be trash that's not collected where you live. Share the photo and tell us a bit about it.

Challenge 2: Find and share a resource (blog post, podcast, newspaper article, wikipedia entry) on that social problem. Share a bit about how open source technology might be able to solve that problem (or why previous attempts have not been successful).

Challenge 3: Download, print and play "Make Change": a game to help you brainstorm ideas for your (maybe first!) project using open source software.

Challenge 4: Write a brief blog post (1-2 paragraphs) that introduces your friction moment, and post the ideas for products you came up with by playing "Make Change"

## Document

* As you complete the challenges, post them to your course repository as an issue.
* Share your final blog post with photos and your emerging product idea in GH pages.
